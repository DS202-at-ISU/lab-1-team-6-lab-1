# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

This is Nadia’s line from RStudio.

**12.2**

The repo was already made!

**12.3**

Gwen: I had no problems cloning the GitHub repository to my computer via
RStudio, creating the project went smoothly

**12.4**

Gwen: This step went smoothly as well. Talking with my group about the
difference between commit and push, helped me to understand what was
actually going on.

**12.5**

Gwen: I was able to push successfully the first time. Group members
struggled with pulling and pushing their changes in this step and it we
tried our best to talk through it with each other and tried different
things.

**12.6**

Gwen: The changes were successfully updated, however when I tried to
pull from the changes the group members have made I had pulling and
merging issues and it took awhile to figure out how to fix. Hopefully
all group members have no more issues!

**Our Groups Experience**

- We were struggling with the push process and some group members were
  struggling with errors and personal access tokens.
- Megan had to configure git, by installing the package, running git
  config user.name and user.email and generating a token (PAT). Then I
  pulled and resolve merge conflicts, made a commit with my text, and
  then I was able to push to main.
